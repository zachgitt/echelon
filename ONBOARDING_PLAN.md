# Phase 4: Organization Onboarding

## Goal
Walk new domain users through creating organization details, departments, and their employee profile in a sequential onboarding flow.

## Architecture Overview

### Signup → Onboarding Split
**Signup creates minimal shell, Onboarding completes the details:**

| **Signup Phase** | **Onboarding Phase** |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Create auth user (Supabase) | Complete organization details (name, slug) |
| Auto-create organization (domain only) | Create departments |
| NO employee record | Create employee profile |
| NO departments | |

**Key principle:** User cannot access the main app until onboarding is complete (org has name/slug, employee profile exists).

## Key Changes from Original Plan
1. **Signup flow auto-creates organizations**: When a user signs up, the organization is automatically created from their email domain (with domain as default name to be completed during onboarding)
2. **No pre-seeding required**: Organizations are created on-the-fly during signup, eliminating the need for manual database seeding
3. API routes placed in `/api/organizations` and `/api/departments` for reusability
4. Onboarding is a multi-step flow: Organization → Departments → Employee Profile
5. User creates their own employee profile as the final onboarding step
6. Existing organization users only need to complete Employee Profile step
7. **Slug removed entirely**: Organization slug field was removed from schema as it's not needed for MVP

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETED

All core functionality has been implemented:
- ✅ Database schema updated (removed slug, kept name as non-null with domain default)
- ✅ Migration generated: `db/migrations/0005_aberrant_menace.sql`
- ✅ Signup route updated to auto-create organizations with domain-based names
- ✅ API routes created/updated: `/api/organizations`, `/api/departments`, `/api/employees`
- ✅ All three onboarding pages created with form validation
- ✅ Middleware updated to handle onboarding flow routing
- ✅ Textarea UI component created for form inputs

**Next Step:** Run `npm run db:migrate` to apply schema changes, then begin manual testing.

## Implementation Details

### 0. Signup Flow Changes

#### `/api/auth/signup` (POST) - ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Changes to existing signup route:**
- ✅ Removed the check that requires organization to pre-exist
- ✅ Auto-creates organization if it doesn't exist for the email domain
- ✅ Organization created with:
  - `domain`: Extracted from user's email (e.g., `"newcompany.com"` from `user@newcompany.com`)
  - `name`: Defaults to domain (can be updated during onboarding)
  - `description`: null
- ✅ NO employee record created during signup (created during onboarding)
- ✅ No default department created (will be created during onboarding)
- ✅ Stores `organization_id` and `onboarding_completed: false` in user metadata

**Implementation Notes:**
- User metadata tracks onboarding state for middleware routing
- Returns `requiresOnboarding: true` in response to trigger redirect

### 1. API Routes (reusable for future CRUD operations)

#### `/api/organizations` (GET/PATCH) - ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- ✅ **GET**: Fetches current user's organization details from user metadata
- ✅ **PATCH**: Updates organization name and description during onboarding
- ✅ Verifies user belongs to organization via user metadata
- ✅ Organization ID sourced from `user.user_metadata.organization_id`

#### `/api/departments` (POST) - ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- ✅ Creates new departments for the organization
- ✅ Returns created department object with ID
- ✅ Verifies user authentication and organization membership
- ✅ Organization ID sourced from user metadata
- ✅ Existing GET endpoint remains unchanged for listing departments

#### `/api/employees` (POST) - ✅ UPDATED
**Implemented changes:**
- ✅ Gets organization ID from user metadata (no longer required in request body)
- ✅ Auto-links employee to authenticated user via `userId` field
- ✅ Marks `onboarding_completed: true` in user metadata after employee creation
- ✅ Supports both onboarding flow and regular employee creation
- ✅ Validates all required fields and handles errors gracefully

---

### 2. Onboarding Pages

#### `/onboarding/organization` - ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- ✅ **Form Fields:**
  - Organization Name (required)
  - Description (optional, textarea)
- ✅ **Features:**
  - Loads existing organization data on mount
  - Shows loading state while fetching
  - Client-side validation for required fields
  - Redirects to `/onboarding/departments` on success
- ✅ **Implementation:** React form with controlled inputs, fetch API for GET/PATCH
- ⚠️ **NOT IMPLEMENTED:** localStorage persistence, slug auto-generation (slug removed)

#### `/onboarding/departments` - ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- ✅ **Interface:** Create multiple departments with add/remove functionality
- ✅ **Requirements:** Minimum 1 department with name required
- ✅ **Features:**
  - Add/remove department fields dynamically (starts with 1)
  - Each department has name (required) and description (optional)
  - Back button navigates to `/onboarding/organization`
  - Validates at least one department has a name
- ✅ **Implementation:** Dynamic form array, parallel API calls for department creation
- ⚠️ **NOT IMPLEMENTED:** localStorage persistence

#### `/onboarding/employee` - ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- ✅ **Form Fields:**
  - Full Name (required, pre-filled from auth)
  - Email (required, pre-filled from auth)
  - Job Title (required)
  - Department (required, dropdown select)
- ✅ **Features:**
  - Fetches user info and departments on mount
  - Auto-selects first department if available
  - Shows error if no departments exist (with back button)
  - Back button navigates to `/onboarding/departments`
  - Redirects to `/search` on success
- ✅ **Implementation:** React form with controlled inputs, sets `hireDate` to current date
- ⚠️ **NOT IMPLEMENTED:** localStorage persistence, inline department creation option

---

### 3. Middleware Updates - ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Implemented onboarding flow logic:**

```typescript
// Uses user.user_metadata.onboarding_completed flag to determine routing

if (user && !isApiRoute) {
  const onboardingCompleted = user.user_metadata?.onboarding_completed

  // If onboarding not complete and not on onboarding path
  if (onboardingCompleted === false && !isOnboardingPath) {
    → redirect to /onboarding/organization
  }

  // If onboarding complete and trying to access onboarding pages
  if (onboardingCompleted === true && isOnboardingPath) {
    → redirect to /search
  }

  // If logged in and trying to access auth pages (except callback)
  if (isPublicPath && pathname !== '/auth/callback') {
    → redirect based on onboarding status
  }
}
```

**Routes handled:**
- ✅ `/onboarding/*` - Allows access during onboarding
- ✅ `/api/*` - Skipped by middleware (APIs handle own auth)
- ✅ `/auth/*` - Public paths for login/signup/callback
- ✅ All other routes - Protected, require onboarding completion

**Implementation Notes:**
- Uses user metadata flag instead of database queries for performance
- Simpler than original plan: relies on single `onboarding_completed` boolean
- ⚠️ **SIMPLIFIED:** Does not check individual steps (org/departments), assumes linear flow

---

### 4. User Flows

#### Flow A: First user with new domain (complete onboarding)
1. User signs up with `user@newcompany.com`
2. **Signup auto-creates organization** with domain `"newcompany.com"`, empty name/slug, and NO departments
3. **Employee record NOT created yet** (will be created during onboarding)
4. Login successful → middleware checks organization status
5. Middleware detects empty org name → redirect to `/onboarding/organization`
6. User fills org details (name, auto-generated slug, optional description)
7. Submit → organization updated → redirect to `/onboarding/departments`
8. User creates 2-3 departments (Engineering, Sales, etc.)
9. Submit → departments created → redirect to `/onboarding/employee`
10. User fills employee profile, selects department from created list
11. Submit → **employee record created** → redirect to `/dashboard` (main app)
12. localStorage cleared after successful onboarding
13. Future logins: no onboarding needed (employee exists, org complete)

#### Flow B: Second user with existing domain (existing org with departments)
1. User signs up with `user2@newcompany.com`
2. **Signup finds existing organization** (domain `"newcompany.com"` already exists)
3. **No new organization created** - uses existing one
4. **Employee record NOT created yet** (will be created during onboarding)
5. Login successful → middleware checks: org complete (has name/slug), departments exist, but no employee profile
6. Redirect to `/onboarding/employee` (skips org/departments steps)
7. User sees list of existing departments, selects one (cannot create new - not first employee)
8. User fills first name, last name, title
9. Submit → **employee record created** → redirect to `/dashboard`
10. localStorage cleared after successful onboarding
11. Future logins: no onboarding needed

#### Flow C: Edge case - Second user before first user completed onboarding
1. User1 signs up with `user1@company.com`
2. **Signup creates organization** with domain `"company.com"`, empty name/slug
3. **No employee record created for User1**
4. User1 starts onboarding, completes org step, then abandons (logs out)
5. User2 signs up with `user2@company.com`
6. **Signup finds existing organization** (created by User1's signup)
7. **No employee record created for User2**
8. User2 logs in, sees org has name/slug but no departments
9. User2 becomes "first employee to complete onboarding"
10. User2 goes through departments → employee flow, completing onboarding
11. User1 returns, org already complete with departments
12. User1 only needs employee profile creation (can only select from existing departments - not first to complete)

- [ ] Check database: org has name/slug, 2 departments exist, employee profile created
- [ ] Verify localStorage is cleared after onboarding complete
- [ ] Log out and log back in, verify no onboarding redirect (goes straight to app)

### Test 2: Existing Organization - Employee Onboarding Only
- [ ] Using org from Test 1, sign up with second user (e.g., `user2@testcompany123.com`)
- [ ] After login, verify redirect to `/onboarding/employee` (skips org/departments)

- [ ] Submit, verify redirect to main app
- [ ] Check database: new employee profile created, assigned to Sales
- [ ] Verify localStorage is cleared
- [ ] Log out and log back in, verify no onboarding redirect

### Test 3: Create New Department During Employee Onboarding (First Employee Only)
- [ ] Sign up with new domain (e.g., `admin@neworg456.com`)
- [ ] Complete org and departments onboarding (create "Engineering" only)
- [ ] At `/onboarding/employee`, verify option to "Create new department" exists
- [ ] Choose "Create new department"
- [ ] Enter new department name "Marketing" with description
- [ ] Fill employee profile details

- [ ] At `/onboarding/employee`, verify NO option to create new department
- [ ] Verify can only select from existing departments

### Test 4: Validation & Error Handling
- [ ] At organization step: Try to submit without name → error shown, stays on page
- [ ] At organization step: Enter name, verify slug auto-generates and cannot be manually edited
- [ ] At departments step: Try to submit with 0 departments → error shown
- [ ] At departments step: Try to submit with department name empty → error shown
- [ ] At employee step: Try to submit without selecting/creating department → error shown
- [ ] At employee step: Try to submit without first name or last name → error shown
- [ ] Verify all error messages are user-friendly and specific

### Test 5: Navigation Guards & Middleware
- [ ] After completing org onboarding, try manually navigating to `/onboarding/organization` → redirect to next incomplete step
- [ ] After completing all onboarding, try manually navigating to `/onboarding/*` → redirect to app
- [ ] Verify middleware doesn't block API routes during onboarding
- [ ] Start onboarding, complete org step, manually type `/dashboard` in URL → redirect back to `/onboarding/departments`
- [ ] Try accessing `/onboarding/departments` as non-first employee → redirect to `/onboarding/employee`

### Test 6: Data Persistence with localStorage
- [ ] Sign up with new domain, start filling organization form
- [ ] Fill name "Test Persistence Org", description "Testing..."
- [ ] Refresh the page
- [ ] Verify form data persists (name and description still filled)
- [ ] Submit and move to departments
- [ ] Add 2 departments with details
- [ ] Refresh the page
- [ ] Verify department form data persists
- [ ] Complete onboarding
- [ ] Verify localStorage is cleared after completion

### Test 7: Abandoned Onboarding & Resume
- [ ] Sign up with new domain, complete organization step only
- [ ] Log out before completing departments/employee
- [ ] Log back in, verify returns to `/onboarding/departments` (where they left off)
- [ ] Verify organization data already saved (don't need to re-enter)
- [ ] Complete departments, log out before employee step
- [ ] Log back in, verify returns to `/onboarding/employee`
- [ ] Verify departments already created (shown in dropdown)

### Test 8: Back Button Navigation
- [ ] Start new organization onboarding
- [ ] Complete organization form, move to departments
- [ ] Click back button → verify navigates to organization page
- [ ] Verify organization form shows previous data (from database, not localStorage)
- [ ] Don't make changes, go forward again
- [ ] At departments page, verify can still create new departments
- [ ] Complete departments, move to employee page
- [ ] Click back button → verify navigates to departments page
- [ ] Complete employee onboarding successfully

### Test 9: Database Migration & Schema Validation
- [ ] Stop the development server
- [ ] Run `npm run db:migrate` to apply migration `0005_aberrant_menace.sql`
- [ ] Verify migration succeeds without errors
- [ ] Open Drizzle Studio with `npm run db:studio`
- [ ] Verify `organizations` table no longer has `slug` column
- [ ] Verify `organizations.name` is non-null
- [ ] Verify `employees.userId` column exists and is nullable
- [ ] Create test organization via UI and verify data structure matches schema

### Test 10: Multiple Departments Creation
- [ ] Sign up with new domain
- [ ] Complete organization step
- [ ] At departments page, create 5 departments at once
- [ ] Verify all 5 departments are created successfully
- [ ] At employee page, verify all 5 departments appear in dropdown
- [ ] Select middle department from list, complete onboarding
- [ ] Verify employee assigned to correct department in database

### Test 11: Empty/Invalid Input Handling
- [ ] At organization page: Submit with whitespace-only name → verify error
- [ ] At organization page: Submit with very long name (1000+ chars) → verify behavior
- [ ] At departments page: Create department with empty name → verify filtered out
- [ ] At departments page: Create 3 departments but all have empty names → verify error
- [ ] At employee page: Submit with whitespace-only name → verify error
- [ ] At employee page: Submit with invalid email format → verify error
- [ ] Verify all error messages are clear and actionable

### Test 12: Concurrent User Onboarding (Race Conditions)
- [ ] User A signs up with `user1@racetest.com`
- [ ] User A completes organization step but leaves departments incomplete
- [ ] User B signs up with `user2@racetest.com` (same domain)
- [ ] User B sees existing organization (created by User A)
- [ ] User B completes departments step (becomes first to complete)
- [ ] User B completes employee step successfully
- [ ] User A returns and continues from departments page
- [ ] User A should see departments created by User B
- [ ] User A completes employee step (should only select department, not create)
- [ ] Verify both users have employee records with correct organization

### Test 13: API Error Handling & Network Issues
- [ ] Start onboarding, disconnect from network
- [ ] Try to submit organization form → verify error message shown
- [ ] Reconnect network, verify can retry successfully
- [ ] At departments step, create department that triggers API error (if possible)
- [ ] Verify error is caught and displayed to user
- [ ] Verify partial department creation doesn't break the flow
- [ ] Test with slow network (throttle in DevTools) → verify loading states work

### Test 14: Browser Compatibility & Refresh Behavior
- [ ] Complete organization step
- [ ] Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R)
- [ ] Verify user stays on departments page (not redirected back)
- [ ] Verify organization data persists (saved to DB, not lost)
- [ ] Complete departments, hard refresh
- [ ] Verify user stays on employee page
- [ ] Verify departments exist in dropdown
- [ ] Test in different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari if available)

### Test 15: Supabase Auth Edge Cases
- [ ] Complete onboarding fully
- [ ] Manually clear Supabase session from browser storage
- [ ] Try to access `/search` → verify redirect to login
- [ ] Log back in → verify no onboarding redirect (goes to app)
- [ ] Start new onboarding, complete org step
- [ ] Manually update `user.user_metadata.onboarding_completed` to `true` in Supabase dashboard
- [ ] Refresh browser → verify redirects to `/search` (bypasses remaining steps)
- [ ] Verify app doesn't crash if employee record missing (edge case from manual metadata edit)

### Test 16: Form Field Pre-population
- [ ] Sign up with `john.doe@example.com` and name "John Doe"
- [ ] At employee onboarding page, verify name field is pre-filled with "John Doe"
- [ ] Verify email field is pre-filled with "john.doe@example.com"
- [ ] Edit name to "Jonathan Doe", submit
- [ ] Verify employee record created with "Jonathan Doe" (not original)
- [ ] Log out and log in again
- [ ] Verify app shows "Jonathan Doe" everywhere (employee name used, not auth name)

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Database Considerations
- **Organizations auto-created on signup**: Each unique email domain gets its own organization
- Organization slug should be validated for uniqueness (though domain-based orgs shouldn't conflict)
- Slug is immutable after creation (enforce in DB and API)
- **Employee records created during onboarding, NOT during signup**
- Employee profile has 1:1 relationship with user per organization
- Track "first employee" by checking if any completed employee profiles exist for the org
- **No default departments created during signup** - created during onboarding flow

### Frontend Considerations
- Use form library (e.g., react-hook-form) for complex multi-field validation
- Implement localStorage sync on form change (debounced to avoid excessive writes)
- Clear localStorage after successful onboarding completion
- Auto-generate slug from organization name (lowercase, hyphens, remove special chars)
- Show loading states during API calls
- Handle API errors gracefully with user-friendly messages

### Middleware Performance
- Consider caching onboarding status in session to avoid repeated DB queries
- Minimize database calls by fetching org, employee, and department count in single query where possible
- Ensure middleware is efficient (runs on every protected route)

### Security
- Verify user belongs to organization before allowing any updates
- Restrict department creation to first employee only (except during full onboarding)
- Prevent slug modification after initial creation
- Validate all inputs server-side (don't rely on client validation)

---

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for Phase 4)
- Admin UI to edit organization details (settings page)
- Full CRUD operations for departments (edit, delete)
- Bulk employee import
- Department hierarchy (parent/child departments)
- Employee role management
- Onboarding progress indicator/stepper UI
- Email notifications when organization is created
- Audit log for onboarding actions

---
